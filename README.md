# 🌟 Electricity Production Economic Analysis (EPEA) - 1970 🌟

## Overview 👀
This repository contains the **Electricity Production Economic Analysis (EPEA)** project, focused on the econometric analysis of electricity production costs in the year 1970. Our goal is to understand the economic scales and cost drivers impacting electricity production during this period.

## Objectives 🎯
- Analyze the cost structures associated with electricity production.
- Identify key factors influencing these costs.
- Provide a historical perspective on the economics of electricity production.

## Methodology 📊
The analysis employs various econometric techniques, utilizing the `Electricity1970` dataset which includes data on production costs, output levels, and other economic variables from 158 firms.

### Data Analysis 📈
